## **Excel Data Analysis Project: Increasing Profit in 2015**

### **Project Objective**
The goal of this project was to analyze sales data from the past four years to identify opportunities to increase profits in 2015.

### **Dataset**
The analysis was based on sales data from the previous four years, including order details, market performance, and product categories.

### **Methods Used**
- Created an **Excel dashboard** for visualizing key metrics.
- Utilized **Pivot Tables** to summarize sales and profit data by market, category, and time period.
- Applied **VLOOKUP** to match data across multiple sheets.
- Performed **date reformatting** for accurate time-series analysis.

### **Key Insights**
1. **Total Profit**: The total profit over the past four years was $4.58 billion.
2. **Largest Market**: Latin America accounted for $2.83 billion in profit.
3. **Order Volume**: There were 51.3 thousand orders during the analysis period.
4. **Top Region**: The United States generated the highest profit, contributing $1.8 billion, with New York being the most profitable state at $474.16 million.
5. **Yearly Growth**: Profit increased steadily over the four years, with 2014 seeing the highest growthâ€”almost a 40% increase compared to 2013.
6. **Quarterly Performance**: The fourth quarter consistently performed best, except in 2012.
7. **Top Category**: The technology category yielded the highest profit across all markets.
8. **Effective Discounts**: Most profits came from discount rates between 1% and 6%.
9. **Asia-Pacific Market Losses**: The furniture category saw significant losses in the Asia-Pacific market.
10. **Furniture Profitability**: Only the US and Canada markets showed profitability in the furniture category.

### **Conclusion**
1. **Increase Q4 Advertising**: Given the strong performance in the fourth quarter, increasing advertising during this period could boost profits further.
2. **Reduce Discounts**: Since most profits came from low-discount ranges, decreasing discounts could enhance profitability without reducing sales volume.
3. **Furniture Strategy for Asia-Pacific**: Consider discontinuing the shipment of furniture products to the Asia-Pacific market, or investigate logistics for potential overspending causes.
